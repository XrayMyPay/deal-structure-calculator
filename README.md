## 🧮 Financial Formulas

### Monthly Payment Calculation (Amortizing Loan)
```
PMT = P * [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]
Where:
- P = Principal amount
- r = Monthly interest rate
- n = Number of payments
```

### Net Present Value (NPV)
```
NPV = Σ(CF_t / (1 + r)^t)
Where:
- CF_t = Cash flow at time t
- r = Discount rate (8%)
- t = Time period
```

### Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
Calculated using Newton-Raphson iterative method to find the rate where NPV = 0.

### Tax Impact Calculations
Each deal type applies appropriate tax calculations based on payment timing and structure.

## 📱 Mobile Optimization

- **Touch-friendly**: Large tap targets and intuitive gestures
- **Responsive grids**: Adapts from 1 column (mobile) to 5 columns (desktop)
- **Optimized charts**: Chart.js configured for mobile performance
- **Fast loading**: Lazy-loaded components and optimized bundle size
